#  Joukowski Airfoil Visualization GUI

### Creators: Lucas Calvert, Duncan McGough


#### Usage:
To run the GUI, navigate to the correct directory in a terminal window, type "python joukowski.py" and hit enter. If the GUI doesn't run (or is very jumpy/laggy), it is likely that your version of Qt may need to be updated.

Drag the sliders and switch between view modes to see how different input parameter change the flow around your airfoil.

Drag the red circle on the left to see how different center coordinates change the shape of the Joukowski airfoil plotted on the right.




#### File list:

flat_plate_interactive.py - extra script for viewing a flat plate
